Priority-Based Reorganization: Completely reorganized javascript_notes.md using Impact vs. Effort prioritization framework from Agile First and Parabol resources. Created 5 priority groups: Core Fundamentals (High Impact, Low Effort), Type Handling & Operations (High Impact, Medium Effort), String & Number Manipulation (Medium-High Impact, Low Effort), Date Handling (Medium Impact, Low Effort), and Data Structures (High Impact, High Effort). Added learning strategy guide and clear section headers to optimize learning progression and ensure topic alignment.
Standardize Functions and Parameters Code: 11_function_and_parameter.js has been fully standardized with comprehensive JSDoc comments, fixed typos in function names (sayMyName, addTwoNumbers, add2Numbers), clean console output with variable names for debugging, proper parameter documentation, and following JavaScript Standard Style guidelines. Added detailed explanations for function declaration, parameters, return values, and parameter validation.
Add Functions and Parameters Notes: Added comprehensive section to javascript_notes.md covering functions and parameters, including function declaration and calling, parameters and return values, parameter validation, modern JavaScript features (default parameters, rest parameters, arrow functions), function types (pure functions, side effects, callbacks), best practices (naming conventions, JSDoc documentation, error handling), common errors and debugging, function scope and closures. Updated table of contents and learning priority guide to include Functions & Parameters as a high-priority learning topic.
Enhanced Functions and Parameters Code: Standardized 11_function_and_parameter.js with comprehensive JSDoc comments, fixed variable declarations (using let/const), improved console output with variable names for clean debugging, added rest parameters examples with array iteration, demonstrated rest parameters behavior, and included object parameters with validation. Added detailed notes to javascript_notes.md covering rest parameters with array iteration, rest parameters behavior, object parameters, and best practices for both concepts.
Reorganized Functions Section: Moved "Common Function Errors and Debugging" section to the end of the Functions & Parameters section in javascript_notes.md, following the established pattern of placing error/debugging content at the end of each topic. Added new error examples for rest parameters and object parameter validation, along with comprehensive debugging tips for better error handling and troubleshooting.
Enhanced Functions and Parameters with Scope Demonstration: Standardized 11_function_and_parameter.js by adding comprehensive JSDoc comments for variable scope demonstration, improving console output with descriptive variable names, removing inappropriate comments, and adding proper error handling examples. Added Variable Scope Demonstration section to javascript_notes.md covering block scope behavior, variable shadowing, temporal dead zone, and scope best practices. Updated table of contents to include the new scope demonstration section.
Enhanced Functions and Parameters with Advanced Concepts: Standardized 11_function_and_parameter.js by adding comprehensive JSDoc comments for nested functions, closures, and function hoisting, improving console output with descriptive variable names, removing inappropriate comments, and following JavaScript Standard Style guidelines. Added Nested Functions and Closures section and Function Hoisting section to javascript_notes.md covering closure behavior, lexical scoping, scope chain, function declarations vs expressions, and hoisting best practices. Updated table of contents to include both new sections.
Final Functions and Parameters Enhancement: Added comprehensive documentation to javascript_notes.md covering Function Return Values and Undefined, Parameter Validation and Error Handling, and Console Output Best Practices. These sections provide detailed explanations of return value behavior, parameter validation techniques, and clean console output guidelines. Updated table of contents to include all new sections, completing the comprehensive coverage of all concepts demonstrated in 11_function_and_parameter.js.
Arrow Functions and This Keyword Standardization: Standardized 12_arrow_function.js with comprehensive JSDoc comments, improved console output with variable names, and added detailed explanations of 'this' keyword behavior in different environments (Node.js vs Browser). Added comprehensive Arrow Functions & This Keyword section to javascript_notes.md covering arrow function syntax, 'this' binding differences, best practices, common errors, and debugging tips. Updated table of contents to include the new high-priority section for modern JavaScript development.

Enhanced Arrow Functions with 'this' Demonstrations: Standardized 12_arrow_function.js by improving function names (demonstrateThisInFunction, demonstrateThisWithLocalVariable, demonstrateThisInArrowFunction), adding comprehensive JSDoc comments, improving console output with descriptive variable names, and following JavaScript Standard Style guidelines. Added detailed 'this' Keyword Demonstrations section to javascript_notes.md covering 'this' behavior in regular functions vs arrow functions, key differences in 'this' binding, understanding 'this' context, local variable vs 'this' confusion, and comprehensive debugging tips. Updated table of contents to include the new 'this' Keyword Demonstrations subsection and enhanced the requirements file to document all changes.

Environment Differences Documentation: Added comprehensive section to javascript_notes.md explaining the differences between console.log(this) in code editors (Node.js) vs browsers, including detailed comparison table, practical examples for both environments, explanation of why these differences matter, and debugging tips. The section covers Node.js module context, Node.js REPL context, browser context, and strict mode behavior, providing clear understanding of 'this' keyword behavior across different JavaScript execution environments. Updated table of contents to include the new Environment Differences subsection.

Comprehensive Arrow vs Regular Functions Documentation: Added detailed section to javascript_notes.md covering the 5 main differences between arrow and regular functions based on authoritative sources (Dmitri Pavlutin's guide and DEV Community insights). The section includes: 1) 'this' value differences (dynamic vs lexical context), 2) Constructor capabilities, 3) 'arguments' object availability, 4) Implicit return behavior, 5) Class methods behavior. Added practical examples for each difference, comparison table with additional features, when-to-use guidelines, and best practices summary. Updated table of contents to include the new Detailed Differences subsection, providing comprehensive understanding of when and how to use each function type effectively.
Standardized Arrow Functions Code: 12_arrow_function.js has been fully standardized with comprehensive JSDoc comments, removal of inappropriate comments, improved console output with variable names for clean debugging, and following JavaScript Standard Style guidelines. All code examples now include variable names in console output for clarity. Added and updated notes in javascript_notes.md to reflect these changes.
